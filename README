The C++ library `libsocketpp` is designed to merge the standard C socket system with the
modern C++ I/O system. Within this library, there are multiple classes used for main
user usability and extension for your own libsocketpp derivative.

In short, the main classes to use are tcp::Socket and tcp::Server. All classes that have
the prefix base_ are going to be used as derivatives, not public use classes.

For a tutorial, build the texinfo manual in your prefered format. Read the INSTALL guide
to find out how to build your selected format. PDF or html are reconmended.

If you have any questions, comments, or ways to make this project better, give me an
