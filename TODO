For (1.0.0)
[x] 1. Reimplement package structure with different classes
[x]    a. lsock::BaseSocket
[x]    b. lsock::BaseServer
[x]    c. lsock::tcp::Socket
[x]    d. lsock::tcp::Server
[x]    e. lsock::unix::Socket
[x]    f. lsock::unix::Server
[ ] 2. Implement asynchronous socket executor
[ ]    a. lsock::async::Executor<_SockeType>
[ ] 3. Convenience naming in convenience header
[x]    a. using TcpSocket  = lsock::tcp::Socket
[x]    b. using TcpServer  = lsock::tcp::Server
[x]    c. using UnixSocket = lsock::unix::Socket
[x]    d. using UnixServer = lsock::unix::Server
[ ]    e. using TcpAsyncSocket = lsock::async::Executor<TcpSocket>
[ ]    f. using TcpAsyncServer = lsock::async::Executor<TcpServer>
[ ] 4. Rewrite numerical I/O operators (those are trash)
