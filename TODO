For (1.0.0)
[ ] 1. Reimplement package structure with different classes
[ ]    a. lsock::BaseSocket
[ ]    b. lsock::BaseServer
[ ]    c. lsock::tcp::Socket
[ ]    d. lsock::tcp::Server
[ ]    e. lsock::unix::Socket
[ ]    f. lsock::unix::Server
[ ] 2. Implement asynchronous socket executor
[ ]    a. lsock::async::Executor<_SockeType>
[ ] 3. Convenience naming in convenience header
[ ]    a. using TcpSocket  = lsock::tcp::Socket
[ ]    b. using TcpServer  = lsock::tcp::Server
[ ]    c. using UnixSocket = lsock::unix::Socket
[ ]    d. using UnixServer = lsock::unix::Server
[ ]    e. using TcpAsyncSocket = lsock::async::Executor<TcpSocket>
[ ]    f. using TcpAsyncServer = lsock::async::Executor<TcpServer>
[ ] 4. Rewrite numerical I/O operators (those are trash)
