and the C++ standard I/O system. It includes classes for basic use
and extention.

@chapter Overview
Welcome to libsocketpp, the C++ library for networking sockets. If you don't know
already, a socket is a connection between two networking hubs like computers and
modems. Before now, the standard socket system for C++ was the C socket system. Although
excellent for C, the C socket system was designed for use in the C programming language,
not C++. One of the key differences between C++ and C is that C++ is object oriented, which
means that it uses classes and objects. One of the objectives of libsocketpp was to
integrate the C socket system into an object oriented system built for C++.

Another objective of libsocketpp is to integrate the C socket system into the C++
standard I/O system. The standard C++ I/O system is built around buffer and stream classes.
A buffer is a container of data to be moved over a stream, and a stream is a connection
between two points that sends and recieves data between the two points. The stream writes
data into and reads data from a buffer. Libsocketpp works on this system because the socket
sends and recieves data across the internet and stores the data into the buffer.
